ðŸ”­ At 23, I am navigating the dynamic landscape of Computer Science and Engineering as both a student and a tech entrepreneur. I proudly serve as the Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Pharme, a pioneering digital platform streamlining drug availability checks and facilitating pick-up bookings.

While my academic and entrepreneurial journey has exposed me to various facets of technology, lately, I have found myself drawn towards computer security, a discipline that intrigues me with its evolving complexities and the challenge to safeguard digital realms. Though my earlier passions included Blockchain and Web Design, I now find myself captivated by the ever-changing intricacies of cybersecurity.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I relish the process of problem-solving. Crafting elegant solutions to pressing challenges is not just a professional endeavour for me; it is a personal passion.
