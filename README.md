ðŸ”­ At 24 years old, I am navigating the dynamic IT and engineering landscape as a student and a technology entrepreneur. I am proud to have co-founded and served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Pharme, a cutting-edge digital platform that simplifies medication availability checks and facilitates pickup reservations.

While my academic and entrepreneurial journey has exposed me to various facets of technology, lately, I have found myself drawn to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, disciplines that intrigue me because of their evolving complexity and each needing the other to create more cutting-edge systems. Although my previous passions included Blockchain and Web Design, I now find myself fascinated by the evolving complexities of cybersecurity.

Beyond my technical interests, I enjoy the problem-solving process. Creating elegant solutions to pressing challenges is not only a professional endeavour for me; it is a personal passion.
